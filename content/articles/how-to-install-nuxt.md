Nuxt JS is a framework built on Vue JS, this is one of the easiest frameworks to use in 2020 to make websites from scratch and to have complete control over style and functions. All for free, for the most part.

Nuxt JS is included with yarn and npm or can be added as a dependancy to a package.json file in an existing web application

## Prerequisites

Install [Node for your device](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Installing Yarn

To install yarn, a known mac package manager is [Home Brew](https://brew.sh/) to check if you have Home Brew installed open the mac terminal and run the command:

```
brew -v
```

Otherwise install Home Brew with the command:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

Then to install yarn simply run:

```
brew install yarn
```

Easy right!

Now to make a website using Nuxt JS we simply run the command:

```
yarn create nuxt-app <your-awesome-project-name>
```

And follow the [on screen instructions]() to set up the working directory!

Now you can make any website you can imagine. Maybe a [landing page]() or a [blog]() just like the one you're reading right now!
